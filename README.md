# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Module 01 - Kickstarter Assignment : A visual representation of global kickstarter campaign trends of both successful and failed projects, tailored for a US Theater client. 

## Category and Subcategory Outcomes

As far as successful campaigns go, Theater is a great category to be in: In the US alone, there were 525 successful theater campaigns.  58% of all Theater campaigns were fully funded!

Within the US Theater category, Plays were popular projects and strong performers. Most campaigns originated in this subcategory, and 61% of them were successful.

All plays of interest from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe  met or exceeded their fundraising goal!

## Launch Timing

Looking at *when* to start your campaign, May has the most *successful* launches for the Theater category, with a downward trend for the rest of the year.  January, June, July and October all had about the same number of *failed* campaigns. December had more failed than successful campaigns, yikes!

## Central Tendency and Spread

The mean goal of failed campaigns was around double that of successful ones, *and* Louise has a goal much higher than the average of historical campaigns.  The data for failed pledges is much lower than for those of successful ones, so the goal amount does not appear to factor into the ability to collect pledges, which is good news for Louise.

Louise has a Musical Theater project in mind with a budget of 4000 pounds. Looking at Great Britainâ€™s Musical Theater market.  This box and whisker chart shows the mean goal is around 4000 pounds but this is more than the range for what was actually pledged.

## Recommendations

Theater / Play projects in the US have strong historical performance.  The month of May has the highest number of successful launches, with a downward trend for the rest of the year.  Plan to launch in May, and avoid launching in December. 

The *Fever* budget you have proposed is $10,000.  This is unfortunately close to the mean average of failed campaigns in the same category, and double the median of failed campaigns.  Furthermore, the current goal is double the average pledged amount of successful campaigns and $7k *over* the median pledge amount of successful campaigns.  I recommend reviewing your proposed budget and looking for opportunities to streamline your spending. The silver lining here is that there does not appear to be correlation between the amount asked and the amount pledged, so if you do come in with a final budget over the successful mean, you are not automatically set up for failure.  Different factors appear to be causing failure, possibly such as launch timing.

Your proposed British Musical Theater project is also likely over budgeted.  Shoot for a budget within the range of what was actually pledged: no more than 3,000 pounds.
